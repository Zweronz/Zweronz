Decomp And Recomp is a project led by myself to widely decompile and port (mostly mobile) games created in the Unity Engine.
Some notable projects include:

- [Samurai vs Zombies](https://github.com/Decomp-And-Recomp/Samurai-Vs-Zombies)
- [Star Warfare](https://github.com/Decomp-And-Recomp/Star-Warfare)
- [Zombieville USA 2](https://github.com/Decomp-And-Recomp/Zombieville-USA-2)
- The Call of Mini series

And plenty of others on the way.

# Asset Dumps
During my time not decompiling unity games, I'm working towards remaking games in unity.
As well as just improving the modding for various older games.
